It was a really cool challenge from Front-end Mentor, https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI
I had a lot of fun practicing all i learned up until know. I am super happy that it is working and looks like the design.

What i learned in this one:

<ul>
    <li>How to make gradients in css</li>
    <li>How to make a circle with a number in the center, with a combination of width, height, padding, border-radius, text-align and the magic ingredient line-height </li>
    <li>Handling events for multiple elements, this tutorial was really usefull https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwq1Hj1DyDM</li>
</ul>

The css and html could use a bit of refactoring but it's globally clean.
